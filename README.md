# Rock Paper Scissors Game Task

This repository contains my solution for the Rock Paper Scissors game task as part of the interview process for the Flutter Developer position at Fidibo.

## About

The task is to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the following scenario:

- Create 5 rocks, 5 papers, and 5 scissors.
- Rocks, papers, and scissors are square containers. The difference between them can be shown using colors, text, and images.
- Randomly drop these objects on the screen.
- The objects will start moving in a random direction and bounce off the walls (screen boundaries).
- If two objects collide, they will either bounce (if they are of the same type) or one will be removed from the screen and the winner will bounce (if they are of different types).


## My Experience

I enjoyed working on this task as it allowed me to showcase my skills in Flutter development. I learned how to create a simple game with collision detection and object movement.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. If you have any questions or encounter any problems, please contact me via email.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this interview task.

Best regards,
